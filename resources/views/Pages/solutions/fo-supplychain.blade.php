                        Planning (ERP)

                        sophisticated warehousing, & transportation management are all covered. Although most users,
                        analysts, and experts still referred to it as Finance and Operations, Microsoft now distributes
                        it as two separate apps. Depending on your company needs, the 2-app license allows you to select
                        whether individual users have access to one or both applications. Your Dynamics 365 partner can
                        assist you in determining the best licensing configuration for your needs.</p>

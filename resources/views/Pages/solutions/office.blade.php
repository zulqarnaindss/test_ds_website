                    Happens</h2>
                <p class="p-dynamics-virtual">If you are in your house and your office system crashes, or your work
                    building is on fire or flood, you are doomed. Your data is lost, servers are gone, & the website is
                    down. As per the study done by the Institute for Business and Home Safety, 25% of small businesses
                    do not reopen after getting affected by any significant disaster. Using office 365, you can send all
                    your data, business documents, and applications to the cloud. Therefore, your emails will always be
                    available no matter what happens.</p>

                <h2 class="heading-marketing-2-sect-h">Control your Data and Secure It</h2>
                <p class="p-dynamics-virtual">Once your data is in the cloud, there are no more security threats. Office
                    365 has built-in security so that small companies focus more on their business. Therefore, take a
                    step forward and store all your data safely in the cloud. Storing your emails, documents, and other
                    data on the cloud keeps them safe if any disaster happens. Many thanks to 1TB of OneDrive online
                    storage. Your data is safer than before.</p>

                <p class="p-dynamics-virtual"> Back in the day, working remotely or from home was a pain as you would
                    require IT assistance or someone
                    to set up a VPN to get access to your files from the office. Microsoft Office 365 makes it all easy
                    for
                    you. No more IT person or IT skills are required, all you need is an internet connection, & you can
                    have
                    all the access from anywhere.

                    facing that red popup or a reminder to clean up your emails. Stay calm and enjoy your 50GB of email

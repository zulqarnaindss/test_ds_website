                <p class="top-tra-p">Dynamics Stream training services are a systematic process that enables the end
                    users to perform their assigned responsibilities. Usually, the training is instructor-led, with the
                    purpose of training end users while defining significant users in specific responsibilities &
                    designating them as internal champions to empower internal users as needed. The training is improved
                    further when users do a User Acceptance of system that utilizes approach hands-on with the support
                    of the training consultant.
                    Functional Consultants who are generally involved in project execution deliver the training. This
                    guarantees that the trainer knows unique training requirements & is familiar with the user group.

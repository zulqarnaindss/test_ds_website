                <p class="sect-l-p">Most public data consists of accounting, financing, regulatory requirements, and
                    employee management. In most cases, public information is confidential, secret, and highly complex,
                    demanding reliability, visibility, and accountability following worldwide security and federal
                    government requirements. So there is a need for reliable cloud-based public sector ERP software to
                    satisfy and secure the requirements of people, residents, coworkers, and public sector employees.

                    Dubai, UAE, and the Middle East public sector, ensuring a safe and productive service through the
